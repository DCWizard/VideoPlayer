# VideoPlayer
A simple video player for Phone, Pad and the web browser

Player feature: 
- An inteligent context menu.
- The ability to move/jog forward and backward at the speed you like. the slower you swipe/move the mouse the slower the video move. And vice-versa.
- I might make a version that plays internet URLs. Stay tune.

The reason why I Made this video player:
- I was sick and tired of trying to find one that will work for me. As they all get it wrong (sucks).
- When you click on the video it shall stop or play right away.
- When you click back or forth it should move the video no more than 2 sec. I just want to relisten to the last phrase.


Why on the web Browser?
- Most App Can be done directly in the browseer. No need to install a bunch of garbage that bload your computer.
- + I don't use any Framework (That sucks too.) That's only fow the weak devlopper. Anything they can do, I can do better. Plus, mine is more lightweight. 
- I really don't have time nor care to repropgram everything for this and that OS, device... What ever.
- Further more, I want someething to be easy to access. No stupid garbage like GooglePlay, MS Store. That prevent you from accessing it for what ever (stupid) reasons
- + GooglePlay does not work in China. and MS Store is limitted. So, FVck'em.
